Welcome Section

My name is Stefano, an aspiring software developer (frontend preference) with CMS and marketing experience. I've been self-teaching full time, with the help of CS50, other online resources and a small network of professional developers to help guide me on my journey. I'm dedicated to writing clear and elegant code and adapt quickly to situations. I'm a huge tech nerd and strive to find innovative and creative solutions to challenges.

About me blurb

I am a proud Canadian with Italian heritage, currently living in Toronto, Ontario with my wife and our two cats. Not only am I a huge tech nerd, but also a pretty big gamer. When Iâ€™m not defending Azeroth, I enjoy the company of friends and family, watching the Toronto Maple Leafs lose and just generally going with the flow.

Before my wife encouraged me to study software development full time, I was a radio commercial and imaging producer for 10 years. My job took me all over Ontario - from Timmins, to Sarnia, and Barrie. It was a ton of fun and I met a lot of amazing people, some of whom have become lifelong friends.

Becoming a developer was something I should have done <b>A LOT</b> sooner. I love the challenges of backend development, the inspiring creativity of frontend development and the immense satisfaction of tackling challenges together as part of a team.

A little web app I created for the marketing team at Global Furniture Group. It was instrumental in creating an SOP on tagging their images with the proper information, saving workers time and promoting productivity.

Here is a link to my github page. Evverything is on here from personal projects to professional improvement resources. I'm always open to feedback on all of my projects so feel free to contact me with any improvements you think I should make!
