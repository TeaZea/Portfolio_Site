# Portfolio_Site

My portfolio site 1.0

This is the first iteration of my portfolio site. It is a one page site, with links in the navbar moving the user around the page. Content will be basic and straight-forward. An about me section, a summary of my educational journey, links to github repos (hopefully to be hosted as well on ghost page) and of course a contact section.

Challenges {

- Keeping the navbar fixed to the DOM as the user scrolls up or down the page.
- Proper, well written content.
- Ways to make the site interactive without over-doing it.
- Hosting applications/projects on a ghost page.

}
